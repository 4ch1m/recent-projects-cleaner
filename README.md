* `File` --> `Settings...` --> `Plugins` --> `Marketplace`
* search for: `Recent Projects Cleaner`
* click the `Install`-button

Or go to the [plugin page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23732-recent-projects-cleaner) on the [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com)-website, download the archive-file and install manually.
